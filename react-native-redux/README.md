This app mostly looks like [This One][1]. According to the article, all visible to-do items will show in a list. You can add one, and search items by enter a filter string.

One thing you will have to pay attention to is the difference between *Presentational Components* and *Container Components*. If you know little about it, you can know it from table below:


|         | Presentational Components        | Container Components                           |
